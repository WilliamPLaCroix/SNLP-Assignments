def get_encoding(alphabet: dict, base: int = 2) -> dict:
    """ Generate an prefix encoding for each element of the alphabet

    Args:
    alphabet - a dictionary that holds in its keys the alphabet item and
                   its frequency as the value, e.g. {'a': 0.5, 'b': 0.5}
    base - an `int` that represents the base of the code. Feel free to make
           your implementation open to other bases. For the purposes of this
           exercise, using only base `2`, i.e. binary code, suffices.

    Returns a `dict` with alphabet items in its keys and the encoding as the
    values, e.g. {'a': '0', 'b': '1'}
