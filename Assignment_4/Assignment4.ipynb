    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The go-to solution for modelling OOVs in the N-gram setting is to introduce a new `<unk>` token in the vocabulary for all unknown words. The `<unk>` token replaces all OOVs and is then modelled like any other word. (4 points)\n",

    "# The Plague of Unseen N-Grams (5 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "A major and very common issue with N-gram modelling is the estimation of probabilities for ngram sequences that are unobserved in the training data. The most popular technique to tackle unseen ngrams is to smooth the MLE distribution. We will deal with more complicated smoothing techniques later in the course, but let's look at a rudimentary smoothing technique called Laplace Smoothing. You can look it up in the [Jurafsky Book](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/old_dec21/3.pdf) \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of Laplace smoothing is simple: You add a count of alpha to all existing bigram counts in the corpus. Consequently, you \"pretend\" that you observed the previously unseen ngrams **once**. For intuition, you can look at Figures 3.1 and 3.6 in the Jurafsky book. Your task now is to implement a Bigram model with add-one smoothing. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The main task is to complete the `BigramModel` class in `smoothed_lm.py`. Finish the functions to count ngrams and compute the Laplace smoothed probability for a given bigram. (2 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now calculate the average perplexity on the test set. You can start conditional probabilitity estimations from the second word (pay attention to the consequent normalization factor for perplexity). Use vocabulary-restricted train and test sets. Use a top_5000 vocabulary. (2 point).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What happens when you vary alpha in the range 0-1? Why is this smoothing inefficient? (1 point)"

    "# Bonus Question - Alternate tokenizations for OOV handling (2 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in the first part that the OOV issue can be mitigated by using the `<unk>` token. Another option to deal with the OOV problem is to change your tokenization schema by making it more granular. A very popular method along these lines is subword modelling. The idea here is simple: you tokenize your sentence into a sequence of sub-words and subsequently span your vocabulary across all possible subwords in the corpus. This makes sure that there is no OOV in the test set, since new words are still composed of the subwords in your vocabulary. \n",

You can use Huggingface's [GPT2Tokenizer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v3.0.2/model_doc/gpt2.html#gpt2tokenizer) to do this.  Find the resulting bigram model perplexity. (0.5 points)\n",
