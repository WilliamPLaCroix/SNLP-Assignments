    "NLTK has a corpus reader for the Senseval 2 dataset. This data set contains data for four ambiguous words: hard, line, serve and interest. You can read more here: http://www.nltk.org/howto/corpus.html (search for ”senseval”). The PROVIDED CODE(???) loads the dataset for you and converts each sample into a sample object. The sample class has two attributes: context and label. Label is the ground truth sense of the ambiguous word. As EM is an unsupervised method, we will only use the labels for final evaluation. Context is the left and right context of the ambiguous word as word IDs: it is a list of integers, which you can use later to index matrices."
